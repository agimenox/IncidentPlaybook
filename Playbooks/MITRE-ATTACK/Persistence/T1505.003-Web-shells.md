### Investigate

`TODO: Expand investigation steps, including key questions and strategies, for Web Shells.`


1. Monitor for:

    a. Unusual error messages in logs
    
    b. Unusual web traffic patterns
    
    c. Unexpected changes in websitesâ€™ document roots
    
    d. IPS/IDS alerts
    
    e. Antivirus alerts
    
2. Investigate and clear ALL alerts associated with the impacted assets

--------------

### Remediate

* **Plan remediation events** where these steps are launched together (or in coordinated fashion), with appropriate teams ready to respond to any disruption.
* **Consider the timing and tradeoffs** of remediation actions: your response has consequences.

#### Contain

`TODO: Customize containment steps, tactical and strategic, for Web Shells.`

`TODO: Specify tools and procedures for each step, below.`

* TODO

1. Inventory (enumerate & assess)
2. Detect | Deny | Disrupt | Degrade | Deceive | Destroy
3. Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act
4. Review web logs to identify instances of the web shell being accessed
5. Issue perimeter enforcement for known threat actor locations

`TODO: Consider automating containment measures using orchestration tools.`

#### Eradicate

`TODO: Customize eradication steps, tactical and strategic, for Web Shells.`

`TODO: Specify tools and procedures for each step, below.`

1. Close the attack vector
2. Patch asset vulnerabilities
3. Scan web servers for other instances of web shells
4. Determine how the web shell was placed on the system
5. Reset any potentially compromised passwords
6. Review logs of any system the attacker may have accessed
7. Scan affected systems with antivirus/endpoint software


#### Reference: Remediation Resources

`TODO: Specify financial, personnel, and logistical resources to accomplish remediation.`

--------------

### Communicate

`TODO: Customize communication steps for Web Shells`

`TODO: Specify tools and procedures (including who must be involved) for each step, below, or refer to overall plan.`

In addition to the general steps and guidance in the incident response plan:

1. Perform routine cyber hygiene due diligence
2. Engage external cybersecurity-as-a-service providers and response professionals

--------------

### Recover

`TODO: Customize recovery steps for Web Shells.`

`TODO: Specify tools and procedures for each step, below.`

1. Restore to the RPO within the RTO
2. Address collateral damage
3. Determine the root cause of the breach
4. Resolve any related security incidents

In addition to the general steps and guidance in the incident response plan:

1. TODO
