### Remediate

* **Plan remediation events** where these steps are launched together (or in coordinated fashion), with appropriate teams ready to respond to any disruption.
* **Consider the timing and tradeoffs** of remediation actions: your response has consequences.

### Lessons Learned

The goal of the phase is to discover how to improve the incident response process.  
You need to answer some basic questions, using developed incident report:  

- What happened?  
- What did we do well?  
- What could we have done better?  
- What will we do differently next time?  

The incident report is the key to improvements.  

`TODO: Add items that will occur post recover.`
  
1.    Perform routine cyber hygiene due diligence
2.    Engage external cybersecurity-as-a-service providers and response professionals
 

##### Develop the incident report

Develop the Incident Report using your corporate template.  

It should include:  

1. Executive Summary with a short description of damage, actions taken, root cause, and key metrics (Time To Detect, Time To Respond, Time To Recover etc)  
2. Detailed timeline of adversary actions mapped to [ATT&CK tactics](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/), but most probably most of the actions will be in Actions On Objective stage, which is not very representative and useful)  
3. Detailed timeline of actions taken by Incident Response Team  
4. Root Cause Analysis and Recommendations for improvements based on its conclusion  
5. List of specialists involved in Incident Response with their roles
